## **Technologies Used**

- **Swift**: Core programming language for the app.  
- **UIKit**: For building the user interface.  
- **UserDefaults**: For local data persistence of todos and notes.  
- **MVVM Design Pattern**: Ensures clean code separation between the View, ViewModel, and Model.

## **Architecture**

The app is structured using the **MVVM** (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern:

1. **Model**:  
   Represents the data structure (e.g., `Todo` model with `title` and `isCompleted` properties).  

2. **View**:  
   Handles UI components like `UITableView`, `UISearchBar`, and other visual elements.  

3. **ViewModel**:  
   Contains the app logic, such as managing todos, filtering data, and saving/loading to UserDefaults.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Notepad-Todo-App.git
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**:  
   - Open the project in **Xcode**.  

3. **Run on Simulator or Device**:  
   - Select a target device/simulator and press **Run** (`Cmd + R`).
